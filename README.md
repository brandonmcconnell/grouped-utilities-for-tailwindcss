`tailwindcss-multi` is a plugin for Tailwind CSS that introduces the `multi` directive, a utility that allows you to group utility classes together. This simplifies your HTML and improves readability of your Tailwind CSS code.

> ### New name
> The plugin was previously named `tailwindcss-multitool`, but has been renamed to `tailwindcss-multi` to simplify reference.
>
> ### New syntax due to breaking changes
> The value between the brackets in the `multi` directive must now be quoted. This is due to a breaking change introduced in Tailwind CSS v3.3.6.

## Installation

You can install the plugin via npm:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss-multi
```

Then, include it in your `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('tailwindcss-multi'),
  ]
}
```

## Usage

The plugin provides a `multi` directive, allowing you to group multiple utility classes:

```html
<div class="hover:multi-[bg-red-500;text-white]">
  This text is white and the background is red.
</div>
```

The directive accepts a semicolon-delimited list of utility classes and applies them to the selected element. A key feature of `tailwindcss-multi` is its support for arbitrary values, which are not limited to predefined classes in Tailwind CSS.

## Why use `tailwindcss-multi`

In some cases, you may need to apply several utilities to a long or convoluted variant or even chain of variants, which can start tio look like this:

```html
<div class="sm:[&>div]:hover:active:font-bold sm:[&>div]:hover:active:text-[red] sm:[&>div]:hover:active:font-family:['Open_Sans',sans-serif]">
  When hovered, this text will appear bold, red, and in Open Sans font.
</div>
```

This can be difficult to read and understand, especially when the number of utilities increases.

By employing the `multi` directive, you can group related utility classes by variant, providing clearer insights into your code's function. Below is an example that demonstrates the flexibility of the `multi` directive, demonstrating its ability to support not only multiple utilities, but partially and fully arbitrary values:

```html
<div class="sm:[&>div]:hover:active:multi-[font-bold;text-[red];[font-family:'Open_Sans',sans-serif]]">
  When hovered, this text will appear bold, red, and in Open Sans font.
</div>
```

This is‚Ä¶

‚ú® GREAT for consolidating utilities under long & ideally unique variants üëèüèº

üò¨ NOT great for keeping the compile size small if you use it with commonly used variants üëÄ

## New syntax explanation

```html
<!-- ‚ùå before -->
<div class="sm:hover:multi-[bg-red-500;text-white]">...</div>

<!-- ‚úÖ after -->
<div class="sm:hover:multi-['bg-red-500;text-white']">...</div>
```

The release of [Tailwind CSS v3.3.6](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/tag/v3.3.6) (on Dec 4, 2023) introduced breaking changes that broke the original syntax of Multi for Tailwind CSS and several other plugins. 

See [tailwindcss/#13473](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13473) for the discussion that led to this new syntax.

This change required a slight tweak to the syntax of the `multi` directive. Instead of `multi-[...]`, use `multi-['...']` (with a quoted value between the brackets) to pass the grouped utilities together as a string.

Versions of Tailwind CSS thereafter (v3.3.6+) are now incompatible with versions of the original unquoted syntax for this plugin (pre-v0.2.0). Update to `@latest` to ensure compatibility. This new version syntax is reverse-compatible with versions of Tailwind CSS prior to v3.3.6 as well.

Passing the joined strings together as a string allows the Tailwind CSS parser (again, in Tailwind CSS v3.3.6+) to see the value as a valid CSS value and process it as expected.
