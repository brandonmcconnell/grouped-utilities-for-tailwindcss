</div>

`tailwindcss-multi` is a plugin for Tailwind CSS that introduces the `multi` directive, a utility that allows you to group utility classes together. This simplifies your HTML and improves readability of your Tailwind CSS code.

> ### New name
> The plugin was previously named `tailwindcss-multitool`, but has been renamed to `tailwindcss-multi` to simplify reference.
>
> ### New syntax due to breaking changes
> The value between the brackets in the `multi` directive must now be quoted. This is due to a breaking change introduced in Tailwind CSS v3.3.6.

> ```
> ‚ùå hover:multi-[bg-red-500;text-white]
> ‚úÖ hover:multi-['bg-red-500;text-white']
> ```

> See the [New syntax explanation](#new-syntax-explanation) section for more information.

## Installation

You can install the plugin via npm:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss-multi
```

Then, include it in your `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('tailwindcss-multi'),
  ]
}
```

## Usage

The plugin provides a `multi` directive, allowing you to group multiple utility classes:

```html
<div class="hover:multi-['bg-red-500;text-white']">
  When hovered, this text is white and the background is red.
</div>
```
<sup>[View this example on Tailwind Play](https://play.tailwindcss.com/CvOivRIO6w)</sup>

The directive accepts a semicolon-delimited list of utility classes and applies them to the selected element. A key feature of `tailwindcss-multi` is its support for arbitrary values, which are not limited to predefined classes in Tailwind CSS.

## Why use `tailwindcss-multi`

In some cases, you may need to apply several utilities to a long or convoluted variant or even chain of variants, which can start to look like this:

```html
<div class="hover:font-bold hover:text-[red] hover:[font-family:times]">
  When hovered, this text will appear bold, red, and in `times` font.
</div>
```

This can be difficult to read and understand, especially when the number of utilities increases.

By employing the `multi` directive, you can group related utility classes by variant, providing clearer insights into your code's function. Below is an example that demonstrates the flexibility of the `multi` directive, demonstrating its ability to support not only multiple utilities, but partially and fully arbitrary values:

```html
<div class="hover:multi-['font-bold;text-[red];[font-family:times]']">
  When hovered, this text will appear bold, red, and in `times` font.
</div>
```

## New syntax explanation

```html
<!-- ‚ùå before -->
<div class="hover:multi-[bg-red-500;text-white]">...</div>

<!-- ‚úÖ after -->
<div class="hover:multi-['bg-red-500;text-white']">...</div>
```

<sup>[View a similar example on Tailwind Play](https://play.tailwindcss.com/BlZhVpTNyn)</sup>

The release of [Tailwind CSS v3.3.6](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/tag/v3.3.6) (on Dec 4, 2023) introduced breaking changes that broke the original syntax of Multi for Tailwind CSS and several other plugins. 

See [tailwindcss/#13473](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13473) for the discussion that led to this new syntax.

This change required a slight tweak to the syntax of the `multi` directive. Instead of `multi-[...]`, use `multi-['...']` (with a quoted value between the brackets) to pass the grouped utilities together as a string.

Versions of Tailwind CSS thereafter (v3.3.6+) are now incompatible with versions of the original unquoted syntax for this plugin (pre-v0.2.0). Update to `@latest` to ensure compatibility. This new version syntax is reverse-compatible with versions of Tailwind CSS prior to v3.3.6 as well.

Passing the joined strings together as a string allows the Tailwind CSS parser (again, in Tailwind CSS v3.3.6+) to see the value as a valid CSS value and process it as expected.

## What's next?

I think the next natural step in the evolution of Multi for Tailwind CSS is to refactor the plugin as a vite/postcss plugin, as either a supplementary or alternate version of the current Tailwind plugin.

This would allow the plugin to‚Ä¶
* once again use a custom syntax, without quotes
* split any joined utilities into separate classes before the Tailwind CSS parser processes them

If such a plugin could effectively split classes used with the `multi` directive, it would radically reduce the compile size of the CSS output, as the Tailwind CSS parser would only process the classes used within the `multi`, not the `multi` itself.

For example, consider the following markup:

```html
<div class="sm:hover:bg-red-500 sm:hover:text-white">...</div>
<div class="sm:hover:multi-['bg-red-500;text-white']">...</div>
<div class="sm:hover:multi-['text-white;bg-red-500']">...</div>
```

This generates all of these rules:
```css
@media (min-width: 640px) {
  .sm\:hover\:bg-red-500:hover {
    /* 2 lines */
  }
  .sm\:hover\:text-white:hover {
    /* 2 lines */
  }
  .sm\:hover\:multi-\[\'bg-red-500\;text-white\'\]:hover {
    /* 4 lines */
  }
  .sm\:hover\:multi-\[\'text-white\;bg-red-500\'\]:hover {
    /* 4 lines */
  }
}
```

As a vite plugin, that markup would be split into individual utilities like this:

```html
<div class="sm:hover:bg-red-500 sm:hover:text-white">...</div>
<div class="sm:hover:bg-red-500 sm:hover:text-white">...</div>
<div class="sm:hover:text-white sm:hover:bg-red-500">...</div>
```

This post-split example would only generates these rules:

```css
@media (min-width: 640px) {
  .sm\:hover\:bg-red-500:hover {
    /* 2 lines */
  }
  .sm\:hover\:text-white:hover {
    /* 2 lines */
  }
}
```

That's down from 22 lines of output CSS to 10 lines of code, and the same minimal output that would be generated without using the `multi` directive at all.

The strongest argument against using `multi` is output CSS bloat. This is I caution strongly against throughout this README and provide tips for avoiding. It's also something @adamwathan, the creator of Tailwind CSS, discussed at length in [this legendary thread](https://x.com/adamwathan/status/1461519820411789314) when he and his team explored the same idea from a different approach.

Notice the nicer syntax in that linked thread. Something like that *could* be possible with a vite/postcss plugin.

This‚Ä¶
```html
<div class="hover:multi-['text-black;dark:text-white']">...</div>
```

‚Ä¶could become something like this:
```html
<div class="hover:(text-black,dark:text-white)">...</div>
```
