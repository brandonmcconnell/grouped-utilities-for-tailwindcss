`tailwindcss-multi` is a plugin for Tailwind CSS that introduces the `multi` directive, a utility that allows you to group utility classes together. This simplifies your HTML and improves readability of your Tailwind CSS code.

## Installation

You can install the plugin via npm:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss-multi
```

Then, include it in your `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('tailwindcss-multi'),
  ]
}
```

## Usage

The plugin provides a `multi` directive, allowing you to group multiple utility classes:

```html
<div class="hover:multi-[bg-red-500;text-white]">
  When hovered, this text is white and the background is red.
</div>
```
<sup>[View this example on Tailwind Play](https://play.tailwindcss.com/CvOivRIO6w)</sup>

The directive accepts a semicolon-delimited list of utility classes and applies them to the selected element. A key feature of `tailwindcss-multi` is its support for arbitrary values, which are not limited to predefined classes in Tailwind CSS.

### Nested variants (quoted values)

When a value includes a colon `:`, the value must be quoted to ensure compatibility with newer versions of Tailwind CSS. This is due to a breaking change introduced in Tailwind CSS v3.3.6 ([explanation](#whats-next)).

> [!NOTE]  
> One exception to this `:` rule is if the colon is used for a CSS property-value pair, like `multi-[[font-family:times]]`. In this case, quotes are not needed, as this is the expected case for using a colon `:`, which is actually what warranted the breaking change in the first place.
>
> So this is valid:
> ```html
> <div class="multi-[[font-family:times]]">...</div>
> ```

#### Quotes

Valid quotes include single `'`, double `"`, and backticks `` ` ``. The choice of quote is up to you, per usage. Quotes chosen must be kept consistent within the same value.

```html
<!-- ‚úÖ All valid -->
<div class="multi-['hover:font-bold']">...</div>
<div class='multi-["hover:font-bold"]'>...</div>
<div class="multi-[`hover:font-bold`]">...</div>

<!-- ‚ùå Invalid mix of quotes -->
<div class="multi-['hover:font-bold"]">...</div>
<div class="multi-["hover:font-bold`]">...</div>
<!-- etc. -->
```

## Why use `tailwindcss-multi`

In some cases, you may need to apply several utilities to a long or convoluted variant or even chain of variants, which can start to look like this:

```html
<div class="hover:font-bold hover:text-[red] hover:[font-family:times]">
  When hovered, this text will appear bold, red, and in `times` font.
</div>
```
<sup>[View this example on Tailwind Play](https://play.tailwindcss.com/5FoahbwV9z)</sup>

This can be difficult to read and understand, especially when the number of utilities increases.

By employing the `multi` directive, you can group related utility classes by variant, providing clearer insights into your code's function. Below is an example that demonstrates the flexibility of the `multi` directive, demonstrating its ability to support not only multiple utilities, but partially and fully arbitrary values:

```html
<div class="hover:multi-[font-bold;text-[red];[font-family:times]]">
  When hovered, this text will appear bold, red, and in `times` font.
</div>
```

This is‚Ä¶

‚ú® GREAT for consolidating utilities under long & ideally unique variants üëèüèº

üò¨ NOT great for keeping the compile size small if you use it with commonly used variants üëÄ

## New syntax explanation

```html
<!-- ‚ùå before -->
<div class="hover:multi-[hover:bg-red-500;text-white]">...</div>

<!-- ‚úÖ after -->
<div class="hover:multi-['hover:bg-red-500;text-white']">...</div>
```

The release of [Tailwind CSS v3.3.6](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases/tag/v3.3.6) (on Dec 4, 2023) introduced breaking changes that made the original syntax of Multi for Tailwind CSS incompatible with newer versions of Tailwind CSS.

See [tailwindlabs/tailwindcss#13473](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/13473) for the discussion that led to this new syntax.

This change required a slight tweak to the syntax of the `multi` directive. When using a value that includes a colon `:`, instead of using `multi-[...]`, use `multi-['...']` (with a quoted value between the brackets) to pass the grouped utilities together as a string.

> [!NOTE]  
> One exception to this `:` rule is if the colon is used for a CSS property-value pair, like `multi-[[font-family:times]]`. In this case, quotes are not needed, as this is the expected case for using a colon `:`, which is actually what warranted the breaking change in the first place.
>
> So this is valid:
> ```html
> <div class="multi-[[font-family:times]]">...</div>
> ```

Versions of Tailwind CSS thereafter (v3.3.6+) are now incompatible with versions of the original unquoted syntax for this plugin (pre-v0.2.0) for values that contain a colon `:`. Update to `@latest` to ensure compatibility. This new version syntax is reverse-compatible with versions of Tailwind CSS prior to v3.3.6 as well.

Passing the joined strings together as a string allows the Tailwind CSS parser (again, in Tailwind CSS v3.3.6+) to see the value as a valid CSS value and process it as expected.

## What's next?

I think the next natural step in the evolution of Multi for Tailwind CSS is to refactor the plugin as a vite/postcss plugin, as either a supplementary or alternate version of the current Tailwind plugin.

This would allow the plugin to‚Ä¶
* once again use a custom syntax, without ever needing quotes
* split any joined utilities into separate classes before the Tailwind CSS parser processes them

If such a plugin could effectively split classes used with the `multi` directive, it would radically reduce the compile size of the CSS output, as the Tailwind CSS parser would only process the classes used within the `multi`, not the `multi` itself.

For example, consider the following markup:

```html
<div class="sm:hover:bg-red-500 sm:hover:text-white">...</div>
<div class="sm:hover:multi-[bg-red-500;text-white]">...</div>
<div class="sm:hover:multi-[text-white;bg-red-500]">...</div>
```

This generates all of these rules:
```scss
@media (min-width: 640px) {
  .sm\:hover\:bg-red-500:hover { /* 2 lines */ }
  .sm\:hover\:text-white:hover { /* 2 lines */ }
  .sm\:hover\:multi-\[bg-red-500\;text-white\]:hover { /* 4 lines */ }
  .sm\:hover\:multi-\[text-white\;bg-red-500\]:hover { /* 4 lines */ }
}
```

As a vite plugin, that markup would be split into individual utilities like this:

```html
<div class="sm:hover:bg-red-500 sm:hover:text-white">...</div>
<div class="sm:hover:bg-red-500 sm:hover:text-white">...</div>
<div class="sm:hover:text-white sm:hover:bg-red-500">...</div>
```

This post-split example would only generates these rules:

```scss
@media (min-width: 640px) {
  .sm\:hover\:bg-red-500:hover { /* 2 lines */ }
  .sm\:hover\:text-white:hover { /* 2 lines */ }
}
```

That's down from 22 lines of output CSS to 10 lines of code, and the same minimal output that would be generated without using the `multi` directive at all.

The strongest argument against using `multi` is output CSS bloat. This is I caution strongly against throughout this README and provide tips for avoiding.

It's also something [**@adamwathan**](https://github.com/adamwathan), the creator of Tailwind CSS, discussed at length in [this legendary thread](https://x.com/adamwathan/status/1461519820411789314) when he and his team explored the same problem space from a different angle.

Notice the nicer syntax in that linked thread. Something like that _**might**_ be possible with a vite/postcss plugin.

This‚Ä¶
```html
<div class="hover:multi-['text-black;dark:text-white']">...</div>
```

‚Ä¶could become something like this:
```html
<div class="hover:(text-black,dark:text-white)">...</div>
```
